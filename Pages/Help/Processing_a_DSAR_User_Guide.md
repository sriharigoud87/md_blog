# How to process a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) - User Guide

## Submission of Request

All DSA requests are submitted through the form on the website privacy portal or the IVR (toll-free number).

Under CCPA, California residents can make the following requests: Summarized Categories of Information, Copy of Information, Opt-Out, and Delete Data

Nevada residents can make Opt-Out requests 

Data Governance Tool users are generally assigned Action Items by their respective Admins when a DSA request comes in. This guide demonstrates all the steps involved in processing a DSA request from the user's standpoint.

    </p>

-	Once the requestor submits a request, the request will flow to the Data Governance Tool under the DSAR Option.
-	At the same time, an email will be sent to the requestor to verify the primary email address provided in the request submission form

> **Note:** The request is saved temporarily until the web job runs. This happens automatically every hour. The web job will move the request that was temporarily saved to the processing automatically.

-	Once the request is moved to the processing queue, the DSAR configuration created by your admin will start running. As per the instructions, the request will be sent to the respective users for processing as action items. The admin can also manually create action items if required.

### Request Processing is categorized into:

- Validate Request
- Process Request
- Build Report (only required for a specific type of request)
- Deliver

-	There are only 2 categories wherein the user will be involved. They are - **Validate Request** and **Process Request**


## Validate Request

Validation of Request is a step in processing the DSA request that involves matching the requestor's details against the customer master database to consider it a valid request. The request can be processed if the requestor details are found in the database; otherwise, additional information is needed.

-	Once the request is in the In Validation state, the specified user to whom the task has been assigned will receive an email directing them to the Action Item
