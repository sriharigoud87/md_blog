# Data Life Cycle Management 

The volume and complexity of digital data generated by companies and their customers are exploding exponentially. Managing this data requires a deep understanding of the data lifecycle, right from its creation to deletion.  

Meru’s DataGovernance Tool provides an end-to-end understanding of how and what data is created, shared, transformed, consumed, and eventually destroyed. It provides the complete picture of data to ensure compliance across the entire data footprint and better security controls.  

Obtaining full insight into the data life cycle helps organizations unlock the value of data within their systems. 

### An active and fully operational information management plan helps you: 

- Ensure compliance to regulatory requirements 

- Increase efficiency while also increasing security and internal controls 

- Bring consistency across the organization on information governance – for example by integrating your records and information management programs with privacy and other compliance programs 

## How Meru’s products help in this journey: 

1. Data Maps: The Data Map provides a comprehensive footprint of data and data-related processes across the organization. A robust Data Map can help you understand the purpose, use, and flow of data to prevent over accumulation of data. 

2. Data Retention: Data retention policy defines the legal and operational requirements of a particular type of data. Following a retention schedule ensures the regular disposal of data that doesn’t hold any business or regulatory value. 
  Meru's retention management system allows you to define and govern your retention needs and create actionable and dynamic retention policies. Our tool facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements, deletion of ROT data, improved security, and reduced costs. 

3. Data Classification: Classification of data is the process of analyzing structured or unstructured data and categorizing it based on its type, value, and sensitivity. It provides visibility around data and enables better decision making around deletion. 

Meru’s DataGovernance Tool can map all this information and help in developing an effective data minimization strategy. Studying these patterns can help in making critical decisions around retention and deletion of data. Mapping the data you have against the data retention schedule will help in understanding gaps and developing a plan for implementing data minimization across the enterprise. Proper execution of this strategy will ensure the protection of sensitive data and disposal of trivial data while preventing excessive collection of data.
