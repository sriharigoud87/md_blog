# Meru Products 

Meru’s products help organizations gain a competitive advantage in their Privacy and Information Governance (IG) efforts by striking the right balance between process simplification 
and technology automation. Our simple and sustainable approach to IG makes it easier to manage enterprise data and derive maximum value from it. 

Compliance and governance require functional and robust tools that can help in understanding and benefiting from the data within the organization. And our application enables this by 
bringing Cyber Security, Privacy, Data Analytics, and Information Governance practices together so that you can truly turn your data into an Asset. 

Our products provide a holistic solution for managing all your IG and Privacy needs. From the moment the data is created to its management and ultimate deletion, manage your data 
through its complete lifecycle using the Meru DataGovernance Tool. 

## Our Products 

> #### 1. [**Data Map**](Pages/Products/Data_Map.md)

Data Map: Meru’s Data Map provides a comprehensive footprint of data and data-related processes across the organization. It is a catalog of what data is created, how it is classified, where it is stored, and how it travels within and outside the organization.

The Data Map contains information about all systems within the organization and shows the flow of data from one system to another. It gives you a bigger picture of the current state of data for implementing the necessary controls for its governance and security.


> #### 2. [**Data Life Cycle Management**](Pages/Products/Data_Life_Cycle_Management.md)
    
Meru’s DataGovernance Tool provides an end-to-end understanding of how and what data is created, shared, transformed, consumed, and eventually destroyed within the organization. It gives a full insight regarding the data to ensure compliance across the entire data footprint and better security controls.

> #### 3. [**Managing Subject Access Request**](Pages/Products/Managing_Subject_Access_Request.md)
    
Our tool can quickly create and automate workflows within your organization for processing DSARs. It integrates with the Data Map to identify the type of data, its location, to whom it belongs, etc., which helps in the swift fulfillment of requests.

Our built-in customizable workflows and automated APIs can collect or delete necessary personal data from several systems. This ensures timely responses to customer requests in a secure manner and increases efficiency for managing requests.


> #### 4. [**Privacy Impact Assessment**](Pages/Products/PIA.md)

PIA is conducted to analyze the collection, sharing, use, and maintenance of personally identifiable information within the company. Meru’s PIA assessment is based on the privacy impact drivers for each system or process, where the Data Map captures and tracks the risks identified for the systems. It demonstrates how the privacy protections have been consciously incorporated at the system level and across the company throughout the information life cycle.

 The PIA enables you to maintain a Privacy Risk Register and evaluate the overall privacy maturity for the organization, with customizable attributes for the risk register based on your requirements. Our tool can be used to create a PIA in minutes to track, monitor, score, and measure your progress in privacy.


> #### 5. [**Retention Management**](Pages/Products/Retention_Management.md)

Apart from properly governing and managing the data, it is also important to dispose of the data after its useful life. A data retention policy defines the legal and operational requirements of a particular type of data. Following a retention schedule ensures the regular disposal of data that doesn’t hold any business or regulatory value.

Meru’s retention management system allows you to define and govern your retention needs based on the type of data, business and regulatory requirements. It can help you build well-managed retention processes that will be in concert with the data classification efforts and will allow flexibility to define appropriate retention schedules. Our tool facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements, deletion of ROT data, improved security and reduced costs.
